# not-listing

A minimal, local-first to-do list app built with Tauri — fast, lightweight, and distraction-free.

## Features

- Add tasks quickly by pressing **Enter**
- Remove tasks with a single **click**
- Instant save to local storage
- Lightweight and fast by design

## Why?

I built *not-listing* because I wanted something simple.  
No AI, no cloud sync, no bloat.  
Just a clean interface to jot down what needs to get done — and move on.
