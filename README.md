# not-listing

This is a simple todo-list done with tauri for the light weight. It stores all the lists within the app.

**Functionality:**

- Input tasks to do
- Button to remove each task
- Press enter to add the task
- Lightweight

## Why?

I needed something simple. Something that was clean, no AI, no cloud storage. Just add things to-do and get the job done
